## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

The only files I worked with for this project were the index.html and style.css
files.

### What I learned

Mainly, I wanted to learn how to work with a design file, in this case Figma.
I've never built a site with design guidelines yet, and I thought this would be
a wonderful practice opprotunity. I didn't watch or read at tutorials; I just
started clicking around to find attributes for the project.

I chose not to implement Sass, Vue, or any other tools that I use as an exercise
in building with the basics of web development. That, and this project was very
simple.


### Continued development

I plan on coninuing to build projects from Figma design files.
